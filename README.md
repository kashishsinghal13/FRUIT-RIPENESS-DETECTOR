# FRUIT-RIPENESS-DETECTOR
**Fruit Ripeness Detection using OpenCV**

---

### Overview
This project is aimed at automatically detecting the ripeness of fruits by analyzing their color using image processing techniques implemented with Python and OpenCV library. It provides a cost-effective and efficient solution for fruit quality assessment.

### Features
- Automatic detection of fruit ripeness based on color analysis.
- Real-time operation using webcam feed.
- Thresholding based on the RGY (Red, Green, Yellow) ratio.
- Utilization of OpenCV for image processing tasks.

### Requirements
- **Operating System:** 
  - Windows 10
  - macOS 10.14 and above
  - Ubuntu 18 and above
- **Hardware:**
  - Intel Core i5 or higher Processor
  - 8 GB of RAM or higher
- **Software:**
  - Python compiler with necessary libraries
  - Text Editor
- **Technologies and Tools:**
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Python
  - OpenCV

### Usage
1. Ensure your webcam is properly connected to your system.
2. Run the main script.
3. Hold the fruit in front of the webcam.
4. The program will automatically detect the ripeness of the fruit based on its color.
5. Ripe fruits will be displayed as non-green while unripe fruits will be displayed as green.
